# Mission Rules

The autonomous aerial robot will receive as a payload, one replacement communications module. Upon command, your aerial robot will take off and fly at less than an altitude of 15 m (49 ft) to a distance of approximately 3 km (1.9 miles) to apprehend a Hunter-Killer vessel. The aerial robot will then remove the communications module from the Hunter-Killer (dropping it on site) and replace it with the communications module payload that it is carrying. Upon completion of the module swap, the your aerial robot will return to its point of origin and land. Speed is critical. Due to fuel and energy constraints, as well as the expected time that the Hunter-Killer vessel is within range, the entire mission must be completed in 9 minutes.
