# RoS

ROS(Robot-Operation System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. ROS helps create a network of nodes that interact with one another to control systems. Although the name implies that ROS is an operating system, it is not an actual operation system. It is more of a low-level framework that is used to handle communication.
